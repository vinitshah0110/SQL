/* Question 1635

Write an SQL query to report the following statistics for each month of 2020:
The number of drivers currently with the Hopper company by the end of the month (active_drivers).
The number of accepted rides in that month (accepted_rides).
Return the result table ordered by month in ascending order, where month is the month's number (January is 1, February is 2, etc.).
